INTERVIEW ROUND GUIDELINES:
- Round 1: Initial screening - Focus on basic qualifications, availability, work history verification, and general fit
- Round 2: Technical/skills assessment - Focus on job-specific knowledge, problem-solving, and situational questions
- Round 3: Final/management interview - Focus on leadership potential, long-term goals, cultural fit, and compensation expectations

POSITION TYPE CONTEXT:
${positionType === 'management'
  ? '- This is a MANAGEMENT position. Focus on leadership experience, team management, strategic thinking, and handling difficult situations.'
  : positionType === 'salaried'
  ? '- This is a SALARIED position. Focus on professional experience, specialized skills, and career development goals.'
  : '- This is an HOURLY position. Focus on reliability, attendance, physical capability, teamwork, and practical skills.'}

JOB SPECIFIC CONTEXT:
${job ? `- Department: ${job.department}\n- Description: ${job.description}\n- Key Skills: ${job.keywords.join(', ')}` : '- General warehouse/tire distribution position'}

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Generate exactly ${getQuestionCount(round, positionType)} questions
2. NEVER repeat any previously asked questions
3. Make questions specific to the candidate and position
4. Include at least one behavioral question ("Tell me about a time...")
5. For management roles, include leadership scenarios
6. Address any red flags from the candidate analysis diplomatically
7. Keep questions professional and legal (no age, religion, marital status, etc.)

Return ONLY a JSON array of question strings, no other text:

${job ? `DEPARTMENT: ${job.department}` : ''}

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT ANSWER FORMAT:
The answers below are the INTERVIEWER'S NOTES, not verbatim transcriptions. Interviewers typically:
- Write brief summaries or key points
- Use shorthand like "yes", "no", "good", "2 years"
- Note their impressions rather than exact words
- Abbreviate longer responses to essential information

DO NOT penalize candidates for short or summarized answers. A one-word answer like "yes" or a brief note like "forklift certified, 3 years exp" is completely valid - it means the interviewer captured the key information. Focus on the SUBSTANCE of what was communicated, not the length or format of the notes.

INTERVIEW Q&A:
${qaContent}

${interviewRound.interviewNotes ? `INTERVIEWER NOTES: ${interviewRound.interviewNotes}` : ''}

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
1. Relevant experience and qualifications (based on what was communicated)
2. Cultural fit for a warehouse/distribution environment
3. Red flags (inconsistencies, evasive answers, concerning attitudes - but NOT short answers)
4. ${positionType === 'management' ? 'Leadership capability and management experience' : 'Reliability and work ethic indicators'}

DO NOT flag as a concern:
- Short or abbreviated answers (these are interviewer notes, not verbatim transcripts)
- Answers that are just "yes", "no", or brief phrases (this is normal note-taking)
- Lack of detail (the interviewer captured what was important)
