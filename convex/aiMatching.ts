=== CANDIDATE ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS ===
You MUST populate the candidateAnalysis section with detailed analysis:

1. EMPLOYMENT HISTORY: Extract ALL jobs from the resume with:
   - Company name, job title, duration (estimate if only years given)
   - Calculate durationMonths for each position

2. RED FLAGS to detect (be specific and honest):
   - "job_hopping": 3+ jobs in 2 years, or pattern of leaving before 1 year (NOT applicable to owners/founders)
   - "employment_gap": Gaps of 6+ months between jobs
   - "short_tenure": Multiple positions under 12 months at companies where they were EMPLOYEES (NOT applicable to business owners, founders, or self-employed - entrepreneurship is NOT a red flag)
   - "inconsistency": Conflicting dates or unexplained career changes - BUT use today's date (${currentMonth} ${currentYear}) as reference. Dates in the current month or recent past are NOT "future dates"
   - "no_experience": Applying for role with zero relevant background
   - "overqualified": Senior manager applying for entry-level (flight risk)

   IMPORTANT: Being a business owner, founder, CEO of own company, or self-employed is NOT a red flag, even if the tenure was short. Entrepreneurship shows initiative and should be noted positively. Only flag short tenure for traditional W-2 employment roles.

3. GREEN FLAGS to highlight:
   - "long_tenure": 3+ years at any single employer
   - "promotion": Internal promotions show growth
   - "relevant_experience": Direct experience in our industry
   - "certifications": Forklift cert, CDL, IT certs, etc.
   - "leadership": Team lead, supervisor, management experience
   - "education": College degree, technical certifications, or relevant training
   - "entrepreneurship": Founded or owned a business (shows initiative and leadership)
   - "technical_skills": Software development, IT, analytics, or technical expertise

=== POSITION-SPECIFIC SCORING ===

TIRE TECHNICIAN - RETAIL - EXPORT POSITIONS:
When scoring for "Tire Technician", "Tire Technician - Retail - Export", "Tire Changer", or similar tire service positions, apply these specific criteria:

HIGH VALUE EXPERIENCE (+20-30 bonus points):
- Previous tire shop experience (Discount Tire, Tire Kingdom, Big O Tires, Les Schwab, local tire shops)
- Automotive service technician or mechanic experience
- Lube tech, oil change technician experience
- Auto body shop experience

MODERATE VALUE EXPERIENCE (+10-15 bonus points):
- General automotive interest or background
- Warehouse/physical labor jobs (shows ability to handle physical work)
- Retail customer service (will interact with customers at retail locations)
- Any job requiring hand tools or mechanical aptitude

REQUIRED SKILLS TO LOOK FOR:
- Physical fitness/ability to lift heavy tires (40-80 lbs repeatedly)
- Ability to stand for long periods
- Basic mechanical aptitude
- Customer service skills (retail locations = customer-facing)
- Reliability and punctuality (critical for retail shifts)

RED FLAGS specific to Tire Changer:
- No physical labor experience at all
- History of attendance issues
- Only office/desk job experience with no indication of physical capability
- Overqualified (e.g., software engineer applying - likely a flight risk)

GREEN FLAGS specific to Tire Changer:
- TIA (Tire Industry Association) certification
- ASE certification
- Any automotive certifications
- Experience with tire equipment (changers, balancers, TPMS)
- Bilingual (bonus for customer service)

4. EDUCATION SCORING (add bonus points):
   - Bachelor's degree: +10 to experienceScore
   - Master's/MBA: +15 to experienceScore
   - PhD: +20 to experienceScore
   - Technical certifications (CDL, forklift, IT certs): +5 each
   - Education should be noted as a green flag if present

5. SCORING:
   - overallScore: Weighted combination (30% experience, 30% stability, 20% skills fit, 10% education, 10% career stage fit)
   - stabilityScore: Based on average tenure and job hopping patterns
   - experienceScore: How relevant is their background + education bonus

6. CAREER STAGE SCORING (for physical/warehouse roles):
   - Extract graduation year (high school, GED, or most recent education) from the resume
   - Calculate years since graduation: ${currentYear} - graduation_year
   - Add to candidateAnalysis: "graduationYear" (the year, or null if not found)
   - Add to candidateAnalysis: "yearsSinceGraduation" (number of years, or null)
   - Career stage bonus for warehouse/physical roles:
     * Graduated 0-5 years ago: +10 points to overall (early career, high energy)
     * Graduated 6-10 years ago: +7 points (prime working years)
     * Graduated 11-15 years ago: +4 points (experienced but active)
     * Graduated 16-20 years ago: +2 points (seasoned worker)
     * Graduated 20+ years ago or unknown: +0 points (focus on experience instead)
   - Note: This is about career stage and typical physical stamina for demanding roles, NOT age discrimination

6. RECOMMENDED ACTION:
   - "strong_candidate": 80+ overall, no major red flags
   - "worth_interviewing": 60-79 overall, minor concerns
   - "review_carefully": 40-59 overall, significant concerns to discuss
   - "likely_pass": Under 40, or major red flags

7. HIRING TEAM NOTES: Write 2-3 sentences specifically for the hiring manager about this candidate's strengths, concerns, and suggested interview questions.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. ONLY use information that is EXPLICITLY written in the resume above
2. NEVER invent or assume company names, job titles, or experiences
3. If the resume doesn't clearly state something, say "based on your resume" instead of making up specifics

SCORING RULES:
- 80-100: Direct experience in this exact role or very closely related
- 60-79: Similar/related experience that transfers well
- 40-59: Some transferable skills, could learn quickly
- 20-39: Limited background but potential to learn
- 10-19: Minimal relevant experience

Return ALL ${jobs.length} jobs in the jobMatches array, sorted by score descending.
Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown code blocks, no other text.`;
